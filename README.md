Summary (HTML):

    This is an HTML file defining a webpage for a "Palindrome Checker".
    It includes Bootstrap for styling.
    The page has a title, a container, a heading, and a form with an input field for a name and a "Check" button.
    There's a space reserved for displaying the result.
    A custom JavaScript file (Palindromes.js) is included.

Summary (JavaScript):

    This is a JavaScript file (Palindromes.js) responsible for the functionality of the "Palindrome Checker".
    It adds an event listener to the "Check" button.
    On click, it prevents the default form submission behavior.
    It retrieves the input value, trims spaces, and converts to lowercase.
    It checks if the input is a palindrome using a loop.
    If it's a palindrome, it updates local storage with the palindromes found.
    The input field is cleared for the next input, and the result is logged to the console.
